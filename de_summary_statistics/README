Summary statistics from differential expression by perturbation analyses. 
DE-by-perturbation analyses were performed using the negative binomial models implemented in the R package DESeq2. 
Multiple testing adjustment was controlled using the hierarchical FDR (hFDR) procedures implemented in the R package TreeQTL. 
One file per cell line is provided. 
Each file has the following columns: 
Cell, Pertubration	: cell and perturbation 
ensembl_id, hgnc_id	: ensemble and hugo gene names
baseMean : mean expression for control 1 (used as reference category) from DESeq2
log2FoldChange, lfcSE, test_stat, p-value : log2 fold change of perturbation from it's matched control, standard errors, test statistic, and p-value from DESeq2
significant_5prcFDR: binary variable indicating if a gene is significantly DE by the Pertubration in the specific Cell at 5% hFDR from TreeQTL
